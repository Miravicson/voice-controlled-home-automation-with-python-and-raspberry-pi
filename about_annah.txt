I have introduced myself before. Just in case, my name is Annah and I am your personal home assistant. I am a product of research and development into advanced artificial intelligence, home automation and internet of things. What I do is help you live conveniently in Tanteeta laboratory by assisting you in carrying out basic house hold instructions.
When commanded, I can switch on and off your lights in various rooms; I can turn on the fan when you are hot and off when you feel cold. I have some cool playlist readily available for you at your command.
